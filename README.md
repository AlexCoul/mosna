# mosna: Multi-Omics Spatial Network Analysis

A package to find patterns and communities in spatial networks of nodes with attributes of possibly high dimension.  
It works on any type of omics data (proteomics, transcriptomics, ...) and technology (MERFISH, CODEX, MIBI-TOF, CyCIF, ...).  
*mosna* allows to train various machine learning models to predict clinical outcome on gradually more complex data (cell type proportions, interactions, niches), while looking for the best hyperparameters for the models.  

For an example of how to use mosna, see the notebook on the [CODEX CTCL data](./examples/_CODEX_CTCL_xy_only_pretreatment.ipynb).
